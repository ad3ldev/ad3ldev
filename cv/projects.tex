      \begin{cvitems} % Description(s) of project
        \item {Developed as a team graduation project for Computer and Systems Engineering.}
        \item {Contributed to the development of two novel models, Personalized Fast FullSubNet (PFFSN) and Personalized Denoiser (PDenoiser), to enhance specific speaker audio.}
        \item {Designed models with real-time operational constraints, achieving a low real-time factor (RTF) of 0.21.}
        \item {Contributed to achieving competitive results in the DNS Challenge 2023, with the PDenoiser model ranking 2nd overall among submissions.}
        \item {Engineered a real-time desktop application with a graphical user interface (GUI) for on-device audio processing, featuring multi-threading and adjustable frame size for optimized streaming.}
        \item {Independently collected and meticulously curated a custom Arabic dataset for personalized speech enhancement, comprising over 83 hours of recorded speech from 30 speakers.}

      \begin{cvitems} % Description(s) of project
        \item {Implemented a robust interpreter for the Monkey programming language from scratch.}
        \item {Added a macro systemÂ to the interpreter for meta-programming and code generation.}
        \item {Developed a complete and functional REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) for interactive use.}
        \item {Included support for integers, booleans, strings, arrays, and hash maps.}
        \item {Implemented core language features such as let statements, first-class functions, and closures.}
        \item {Created built-in functions to extend the language's capabilities.}
